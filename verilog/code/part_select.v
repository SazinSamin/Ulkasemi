In the given Verilog code, the line data[8*i +: 8] is a part-select or slice operation. It is used to extract a specific portion of the data variable based on the value of the loop variable i.

Let's break down the line data[8*i +: 8] = 0x%0h:

data: data is a 32-bit vector declared as reg [31:0] data;. It holds the value 32'hFACE_CAFE.

i: i is an integer variable used in the for loop. The loop iterates from 0 to 3 (i.e., 4 iterations) since i < 4.

8*i: This expression calculates the starting index of the slice for each iteration of the loop. For i = 0, 8*i is 0, for i = 1, 8*i is 8, for i = 2, 8*i is 16, and for i = 3, 8*i is 24.

data[8*i +: 8]: This part-select expression extracts an 8-bit slice from the data vector starting at the index calculated by 8*i and extending to 7 indices higher. So, for each iteration of the loop:

data[8*0 +: 8] extracts data[7:0] (the first byte) of data, which is 0xFA.
data[8*1 +: 8] extracts data[15:8] (the second byte) of data, which is 0xCE.
data[8*2 +: 8] extracts data[23:16] (the third byte) of data, which is 0xCA.
data[8*3 +: 8] extracts data[31:24] (the fourth byte) of data, which is 0xFE.
