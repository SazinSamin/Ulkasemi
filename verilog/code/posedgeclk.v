In the code snippet you provided, @(posedge clk) is a Verilog procedural timing control statement known as a "blocking procedural timing control." It is used to synchronize the execution of a particular block of code with the positive edge of the clk signal.

Let's break down the code and understand its role:

for(int i = 0; i < 20; i = i + 1) begin
This is a loop construct that will execute the statements inside the loop 20 times. The loop variable i starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 19.

@(posedge clk)
This is the procedural timing control statement. It tells the simulator to pause the execution of the code until a positive edge (rising edge) of the clk signal occurs.

d <= $random;
This is an assignment statement that assigns a random value to the variable d. The $random function is a system function in Verilog that generates a random 32-bit number each time it is called.

Putting it all together, the code will do the following:

The loop will run 20 times.
In each iteration, the simulator will wait for a positive edge of the clk signal.
When a positive edge of clk occurs, the statement d <= $random; will be executed, and the variable d will be assigned a random value.
The purpose of using @(posedge clk) in this code is to ensure that the assignments to d happen on the rising edge of the clock signal. This is essential in synchronous digital circuits to maintain proper synchronization between different parts of the design and to avoid potential timing issues. The random value assignment will happen every time there is a positive edge of the clock signal during the 20 iterations of the loop.
